# Applied Partial Differential Equations

Applied partial differential equations (PDEs).

## Introduction

This repository was originally meant to contain a solutions manual to the applied PDE text by DuChateau and Zachmann in which the pseudocode was updated to Python. As such, it would serve as a repository of their algorithms for PDEs. I do intend to eventually finish the solutions manual. I have also added the Schaum's Outline by the same authors because I used it as a refresher on PDEs before returning to \emph{Applied PDEs} after a long hiatus. The context in which I use applied PDEs is exclusively EM. Therefore, I may convert this into a library of EM algorithms or merge it with an existing EM library.

## Structure

The 'applied' directory contains the solutions to the applied PDE text. The 'solutions' directory (to be renamed) has the text while the 'examples' directory (to be renamed) has code snippets. The 'schaums' directory has the Schaums reference. The 'source' directory has source code while the 'text' directory has the text.
