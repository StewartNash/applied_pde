# Applied Partial Differential Equations

Applied partial differential equations (PDEs).

## Introduction

This repository was originally meant to contain a solutions manual to the applied PDE text by DuChateau and Zachmann in which the pseudocode (or was it Fortran) was updated to Python. As such, it would serve as a repository of their algorithms for PDEs. I do intend to finish the solutions manual, but I am not exactly sure what this repository will become. I have added their Schaum's Outline, as it has been awhile since I have worked on their other text and I need a quick refresher on PDEs. The context in which I use applied PDEs is exclusively EM. So I may convert this into a library of EM algorithms or merge it with an existing one.
